# Emotion-Detection-Through-Facial-Expression
This project implements a deep learning-based facial emotion recognition system that classifies human emotions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on facial images to accurately detect emotions from facial expressions.
